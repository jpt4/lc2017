Title:

Formally Specified Digital Logic for Pervasively Reconfigurable Computing

Introduction:

Pervasiviely Reconfigurable Computing is a project to design
reflectively reconfigurable software across the entire computing
stack, from the hardware level up. The Universal Cell is a proposed
digital logic circuit element that supports 1) reversible 2)
asynchronous 3) homogeneously reconfigurable behavior within a single
primitive component. A formal specification of the abstract transition
system that the UC embodies is given using Lamport's Temporal Logic of
Actions (TLA+), and a simulation of the hardware verified by
translating TLA+ terms into miniKanren, a Scheme logic programming
EDSL.

Novelty:

The Universal Cell a single digital logic circuit element that, though
relatively primitive, supports reversible, asynchronous, and
reconfigurable computation in the style of PRC. A full formal model
and simulation is presented here for the first time.

Competition:

Reconfigurable Asynchronous Logic Automata [0] addresses the question
of homogeneously reconfigurable, asynchronous hardware for digital
logic. Reversible reconfigurable hardware, e.g. in the form of
Programmable Logic Arrays [1], or cellular automata [2], have been
studied. Hardware specification, verification, and synthesis targeting
reconfigurable hardware, such as ClaSH [3], are far more mature than
the TLA+ approach described in this presentation.

Differentiation:

To the best knowledge of the speaker, PRC is the only active research
project investigating 1) reversible; 2) asynchronous; 3) homogeneous;
4) primitive, digital logic elements for the purpose of supporting
reflectively reconfigurable programs [0]. The formal specification and
verification of the Universal Cell is thus novel, if only by virtue of
hyper-specificity.

[0] References to similar work would be greatly appreciated.

Relevancy:

The formal specification tool TLA+ is used in industry and academia to
model concurrent, asynchronous, and distributed systems. The abstract
transition system discussed in this work employs TLA+ as the formal
modelling language.

Benefits:

Developers unaware of the process of formal specification and
verification will be introduced to these concepts in the context of a
concrete use-case of TLA+ to specify an abstract transition system.

Concepts:

Reversible and asynchronous digital logic; abstract transition systems
(as per the temporal logic of actions); logic programming.

Skills:

1. How to read TLA+ source.

2. Writing programs in the logic programming paradigm.

Outline:

1. Salutation

2. Introduction of PRC/Universal Cell; informally state desired properties

3. Translation of properties into an abstract transition machine

4. Formal specification of the abstract transition machine in TLA+

5. Encoding TLA+ terms in miniKanren

6. Demonstration of Universal Cell simulator

7. Valediction and references

8. Questions, if time available

Pitch:

Watch as strange and speculative hardware is tamed with math and
functional programming.

Languages:
miniKanren, Scheme, TLA+
